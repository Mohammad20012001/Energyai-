# **App Name**: Jordan Solar Architect

## Core Features:

- Panel Calculation: Calculates the ideal number of solar panels based on energy requirements and panel specifications, considering solar irradiance data specific to Jordan. Factors in panel type, orientation, and shading.
- Wire Sizing: Dynamically determines optimal wire gauges based on calculated current, voltage drop, and safety standards for solar installations in Jordan, to avoid any technical problems.
- Inverter Sizing: Selects the best inverter model based on calculated solar array power, voltage, and Jordanian grid requirements, maximizing efficiency and safety.
- Pricing Data: Fetches and presents current pricing for solar panels, inverters, and wiring materials available in Jordan, automatically refreshing regularly.
- String Configuration Tool: Determines the number of panels per string and parallel strings needed to meet the calculated voltage and current requirements, maximizing system efficiency and safety using AI. The LLM will use reasoning to suggest common wiring errors.
- Comprehensive Report Generation: Generates detailed reports summarizing all calculations, selected components, and estimated system performance, adhering to Jordanian standards.
- System Visualization: Presents a basic interactive visualization of the solar panel layout and wiring diagram for user confirmation and error checking.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sandstone (#D3A625) to reflect the Jordanian desert landscape.
- Background color: Light sand (#F2E6D9) for a clean, desert-inspired background.
- Accent color: Deep blue (#2A4858) for interactive elements, hinting at clear skies and solar energy.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a modern sans-serif suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying configurations and calculations.
- Use clean, geometric icons representing solar panels, wires, and electrical components.
- Subtle transitions and animations to highlight key information and guide the user through the calculation process.
